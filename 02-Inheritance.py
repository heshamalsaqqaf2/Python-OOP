# Concept Of Inheritance
"""
 TODO: Inheritance:
  means embedding the content of a class into another class.
  In Python, a class can inherit from another class and thus get all the functions and variables in it.
  Inheritance can be used to reduce code duplication,
  for example, if you want to create a new class and you have a ready-made
  class with variables and functions that you need to write in it,
  you can make the class inherit them as they are instead of redefining them in it,
  and then you can use all the variables and functions that the new class inherited
  from the ready-made class.
