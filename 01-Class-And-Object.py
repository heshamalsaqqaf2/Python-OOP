  TODO: Class:
  The basic idea of a class is to set up a common format for storing data and provide user-friendly
    ways to access and manipulate that data seamlessly. By its very nature, 
    Glass doesn't store any information,
    which is why it's called a Blue Print.

  TODO: Object:
  The basic idea of an object is to create a replica of the Glass and insert the data
    you want into it while respecting any conditions set in the original Glass. 
    So you can't create an object without a class because
    an object by its very nature is a copy of a specific class.
